# Automated Code Documentation and Query System with RAG

## Application Overview
Develop an AI-powered system that generates comprehensive documentation for software codebases by analyzing code, architecture diagrams, and project files. The system includes a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** module that allows developers to query the documentation and codebase, providing clear and context-aware answers about the system's design, functionality, and implementation.

## Key Problem Statement
Maintaining up-to-date and comprehensive documentation is a major challenge in software development, especially in complex projects with extensive codebases and architecture diagrams. This project aims to **automate** the generation of high-quality documentation and provide an **interactive query system** that helps developers understand and work with the code more effectively.

## Key Components and Technologies
### 1. Multi-Modal Input Processing
- Use **computer vision models** to interpret architecture diagrams.
- Use **code parsing tools** to analyze the codebase.

### 2. RAG Integration
- Implement **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using **LLMs** and **vector databases** to enhance query responses about the code.

### 3. Prompt Engineering
- Use **advanced prompts** to guide the AI in generating clear, concise, and technically accurate documentation.

## Team Roles
### **1. Code and Diagram Analysis Specialist**
- Develop tools to parse and analyze **code structures** (functions, classes, dependencies).
- Implement **image processing** techniques to extract information from architecture diagrams.
- Design **prompts** to translate extracted information into coherent descriptions.

### **2. Documentation Generation and Integration Engineer**
- Create a pipeline to **generate comprehensive documentation**.
- Fine-tune an **LLM** to produce structured documentation (system overviews, function descriptions, class hierarchies, and design rationales).
- Ensure generated documentation is **well-organized, accurate, and aligned with coding standards**.

### **3. RAG and Query System Developer**
- Implement a **RAG system** to integrate documentation with a query interface.
- Develop **retrieval mechanisms** using vector databases.
- Optimize **prompts** for precise, context-aware answers.

## Detailed Workflow
### **1. Multi-Modal Data Processing**
- **Code Parsing**: Extract functions, classes, comments, and dependencies.
- **Diagram Interpretation**: Use computer vision to interpret architecture diagrams.
- **Data Integration**: Combine insights from code and diagrams for a complete project overview.

### **2. Documentation Generation**
- Use advanced prompting techniques to generate structured documentation, including:
  - **System architecture**
  - **Code structure**
  - **API details**
  - **Usage examples**
- Continuously refine prompts to improve documentation clarity and completeness.

### **3. RAG-Enhanced Query System**
- The **RAG system** retrieves relevant information from the documentation and codebase.
- Users can ask questions about **specific functions, design decisions, or implementation details** and receive contextually accurate answers.

## Project Impact
âœ… **Efficiency**: Automates the tedious process of writing and maintaining documentation, saving time and improving consistency.
âœ… **Accessibility**: Enhances code understanding for new team members, reducing onboarding time and minimizing the learning curve.
âœ… **Knowledge Retention**: Ensures crucial design decisions and code details are documented and easily accessible.
